              Lloyd Braun: Serenity now, insanity later. George: When you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Timmy: Did you just double-dip that chip? George: If you can't say something bad about a relationship you shouldn't say anything at all.

              George: What's so great about a mom and pop store? Let me tell you something, if my mom and pop ran a store I wouldn't shop there. Ben: I knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor. Elaine: There's nothing more sophisticated than diddling the maid and then chewing some gum. Stan the Caddy: Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer.
