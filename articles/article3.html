              This week's project included creating a module that would house different classes. <br />
              <a href="../assets/BankAccount2.png"><img src="../assets/BankAccount2.png" alt="code from bank account project" /></a>
              It was the first week that we were told we weren't allowed to create something that would interact with the user and it took all my self control to abide by that.<br />
              <a href="../assets/BankAccount1.png"><img src="../assets/BankAccount1.png" alt="more code from bank account project" /></a>
              I was pretty proud of my code until I sent it to a friend who started pointing out some shortfalls. I wish I had time to keep working on this one but one must keep moving forward!<br />
              Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/miriam-cortes/BankAccounts">here</a>.
